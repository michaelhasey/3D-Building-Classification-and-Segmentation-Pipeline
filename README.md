# 3D Building Classification & Segmentation Pipeline

## Background: 
Autonomous classification and segmentation of 3d objects using deep neural networks has become an extremely useful and effective technique used within many fields including but not limited to the autonomous vehicle industry for roadway navigation, the robotics field for object interaction, and medical field for 3d image analysis.  Though its efficiency, accuracy and speed far exceeds human capacity and its benefits well known, 3D object segmentation & classification techniques have not yet been widely adopted within the Architecture, Engineering, & Construction (AEC) idustry.  However, as interest in AI continues to increase across the AEC industry, from con-tech tools for construction site tracking, robotic navigation of architectural environments, and city-scale architectural analysis, the ability to rapidly classify and segment buildings into their parts and pieces becomes increasingly important.
